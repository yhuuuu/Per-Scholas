                <p class="card-text">
                    If your houseplant problem is that it's started getting leggy and awkwardly tall or is sending out
                    spindly, weak stems reaching toward a light source, it's trying to tell you that it needs more
                    light. Move it closer to a window or switch it to another window that gets more light. South-facing
                    windows are the brightest, north-facing windows offer the least light, and east and west windows
                    fall somewhere in between. And rotate your plants so that all sides of the plant get equal access to
                    the sun and prevent the houseplant problem of lopsided growth.

                <p class="card-text">
                    Unusual growth patterns are a common sign of disease or insect presence. If you see
                    curling or distorted leaves, look closer—you may find other signs of insects or the insects
                    themselves. If you find black spots or fuzzy white spots, it's probably a disease. Use your fingers
                    to crush pests or treat your plant with neem oil. If your plant has a disease, remove affected areas
                    to prevent further spread.

                <h4 class="card-title">Solution:</h4>
                <p class="card-text">
                    If your houseplant problem is brown tips on its leaves, it may be signaling one of
                    the following issues:
                </p>

                <h5>Inconsistent watering:</h5>
                <p class="card-text">
                    Be sure to only water when a plant needs it. And even if your plant can tolerate
                    less frequentwatering,try not to go weeks without watering and randomly surprise it with a
                    well-intentioned deluge. When you water, make sure water runs out of the drainage holes so you know
                    it's not sitting in the pot or onlyreaching the top part of the plant.
                </p>

                <h5>Too much salt:</h5>
                <p class="card-text">
                    This can happen from overfertilizing or salts from treated tap water. Flush the soil with water
                    until it drains clear, or repot your plant into fresh potting mix. Then, go easy on the fertilizer
                    and try watering it with distilled water.
                </p>

                <h5>Low humidity:</h5>
                <p class="card-text">
                    Many houseplants are tropical natives. Place a humidifier nearby if the air in your house or
                    apartment
                    is dry.
                </p>

            <div id="Yellow-Leaves" class="card-body">
                <h4 class="card-title">
                    Solution:
                </h4>
                <p class="card-text">
                    If your plant only has one or two yellow leaves, it's probably not serious—pluck them off, and your
                    plant should be good to go. An excessive amount of yellow leaves, however, could be a sign of a more
                    significant issue. Overwatering kills houseplants just as often as (if not more than) underwatering.
                    Although exact needs vary by plant, a good rule of thumb is to water when the soil feels dry about
                    1/2 to 1 inch down.And most houseplants shouldn't sit in water because constantly wet soil leads to
                    root rot.To avoid this problem, only use containers with drainage holes and empty water from saucers
                    beneath them.

                <h4 class="card-title">
                    Solution:
                </h4>
                <p class="card-text">
                    Are you constantly having to pick up leaves from the floor when you walk by your plant? Some plants,
                    such as ficus, are sensitive to a change in location and show it by dropping leaves. As long as the
                    growing conditions in the new spot are still ideal, it should grow fresh leaves after it settles in.
                    If you haven't moved your plant recently, leaf drop may also indicate low light.
