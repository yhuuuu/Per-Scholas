                <h2>Solution:</h2>
                If your houseplant problem is that it's started getting leggy and awkwardly tall or is sending out
                spindly, weak stems reaching toward a light source, it's trying to tell you that it needs more
                light. Move it closer to a window or switch it to another window that gets more light. South-facing
                windows are the brightest, north-facing windows offer the least light, and east and west windows fall
                somewhere in between. And rotate your plants so that all sides of the plant get equal access to the sun
                and prevent the houseplant problem of lopsided growth.

            </div>
            <div id="Curling-Leaves">
                <h2>Solution:</h2>
                Unusual growth patterns are a common sign of disease or insect presence. If you see curling or distorted
                leaves, look closer—you may find other signs of insects or the insects themselves. If you find black
                spots or fuzzy white spots, it's probably a disease. Use your fingers to crush pests or treat your plant
                with neem oil. If your plant has a disease, remove affected areas to prevent further spread.
            </div>
            <div id="Brown-Tips">
                <h2>Solution:</h2>
                If your houseplant problem is brown tips on its leaves, it may be signaling one of the following issues:
                <h4>Inconsistent watering:</h4>
                Be sure to only water when a plant needs it. And even if your plant can tolerate less frequent watering,
                try not to go weeks without watering and randomly surprise it with a well-intentioned deluge. When you
                water, make sure water runs out of the drainage holes so you know it's not sitting in the pot or only
                reaching the top part of the plant.
                <h4>Too much salt:</h4>
                This can happen from overfertilizing or salts from treated tap water. Flush the soil with water until it
                drains clear, or repot your plant into fresh potting mix. Then, go easy on the fertilizer and try
                watering it with distilled water.
                <h4>Low humidity:</h4>
                Many houseplants are tropical natives. Place a humidifier nearby if the air in your house or apartment
                is dry.
            </div>
            <div id="Yellow-Leaves">

                If your plant only has one or two yellow leaves, it's probably not serious—pluck them off, and your
                plant
                should be good to go. An excessive amount of yellow leaves, however, could be a sign of a more
                significant
                issue. Overwatering kills houseplants just as often as (if not more than) underwatering. Although exact
                needs vary by plant, a good rule of thumb is to water when the soil feels dry about 1/2 to 1 inch down.
                And
                most houseplants shouldn't sit in water because constantly wet soil leads to root rot. To avoid this
                problem, only use containers with drainage holes and empty water from saucers beneath them.
            </div>
            <div id="Dropping-Leaves">
                <h2>Solution:</h2>
                Are you constantly having to pick up leaves from the floor when you walk by your plant? Some plants,
                such as ficus, are sensitive to a change in location and show it by dropping leaves. As long as the
                growing conditions in the new spot are still ideal, it should grow fresh leaves after it settles in. If
                you haven't moved your plant recently, leaf drop may also indicate low light.
